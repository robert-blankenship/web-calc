Wrote this a while ago as practice for mobile-first web app design.

## How to deploy the calculator.
1. Install node modules.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Run gulp.
    ```sh
    node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
    ```

3. Open the file in your browser.
    ```
    # for Ubuntu.
    see index.html 
  
    # for OSX.
    open index.html
    ```
